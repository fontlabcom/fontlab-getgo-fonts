### Supported writing systems


#### Sundanese

Sundanese (ᮃᮊ᮪ᮞᮛ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ) is a Southeast Asian abugida, written left-to-right. The standard form (Aksara Sunda Baku, ᮃᮊ᮪ᮞᮛ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮘᮊᮥ) is used on the Indonesian island Java since 1996 for the Sundanese language (27 million speakers), and is derived from Old Sundanese script (Aksara Sunda Kuno, ᮃᮊ᮪ᮞᮛ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮊᮥᮔ) used in the 14th–18th centuries. The Sudanese language also uses Latin script. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping).
