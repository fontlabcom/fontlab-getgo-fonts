#### Balinese

Balinese (ᬅᬓ᭄ᬱᬭᬩᬮᬶ) is a Southeast Asian abugida, written left-to-right (5 million users). Used for the Balinese language on the Indonesian islands of Java and Bali, mostly for signage, traditional literature, and, on a limited scale, for new literature. Also used for Old Javanese and Sanskrit. Derived from Old Kawi, similar to Javanese. Has 47 letters. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping).
