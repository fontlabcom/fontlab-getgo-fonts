Also used for some varieties of Arabic and for the languages of Jewish communities across the world. Has 22 consonant letters, 5 have positional variants. Vowels in Hebrew language are normally omitted except for long vowels which are sometimes written with the consonant letters אהוי (those were vowel-only letters until the 9th century). Children’s and school books use niqqud diacritics for all vowels. Religious texts may use cantillation marks for indicating rhythm and stress. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping).
