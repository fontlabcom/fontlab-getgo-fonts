# GetGo Fonts for FontLab

The GetGo Fonts for FontLab is a collection of font files, which are suitable for starting your own font project in [FontLab](https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab/).

The fonts are licensed under CC-0 (public domain), Apache or OFL, and are available for download in the FontLab VFJ format. They support a variety of writing systems and design styles, and the collection is growing!
