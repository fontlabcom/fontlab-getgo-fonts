## GG Hint

GG Hint is a light, wide, unicase sanserif design with pixel-perfect manual TrueType Hinting (TTH) for the Latin script. You can use it as reference or hinting source if you wish to create TrueType-hinted fonts. Some lowercase letters are identical to uppercase, other lowercase letters follow a lowercase skeleton but are of uppercase size.
