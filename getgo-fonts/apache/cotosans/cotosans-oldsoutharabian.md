#### Old South Arabian

Old South Arabian (Musnad, Epigraphic South Arabian, Sayhadic) is a historical Middle Eastern abjad, written right-to-left. Was used in the 6th–8th centuries CE in today’s Yemen and throughout the Arabian peninsula for a group of related now-extinct Semitic languages. Evolved into Ethiopic script, was replaced by Arabic script.
