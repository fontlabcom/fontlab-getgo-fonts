Also used for some varieties of Arabic and for the languages of Jewish communities across the world. Has 22 consonant letters, 5 have positional variants. Vowels in Hebrew language are normally omitted except for long vowels which are sometimes written with the consonant letters אהוי (those were vowel-only letters until the 9th century). Children’s and school books use niqqud diacritics for all vowels. Religious texts may use cantillation marks for indicating rhythm and stress.
