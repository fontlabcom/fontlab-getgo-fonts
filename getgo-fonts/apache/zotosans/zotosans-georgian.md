### Supported writing systems


#### Georgian

Georgian (ქართული) is a European alphabet, written left-to-right (4.5 million users). Used for the Georgian language of Georgia, and other Kartvelian languages. Since 430 CE, the Georgian language used an inscriptional form (Asomtavruli), which evolved into a manuscript form (Nuskhuri). These are categorized as Khutsuri (ecclesiastical): Asomtavruli is uppercase, Nuskhuri is lowercase. Khutsuri is still used for liturgical purposes, but was replaced by a new case-less form (Mkhedruli) used for nearly all modern Georgian writing. In the 1950s, Akaki Shanidze attempted to add Asomtavruli as uppercase and use Mkhedruli for lowercase, but the effort did not succeed.
