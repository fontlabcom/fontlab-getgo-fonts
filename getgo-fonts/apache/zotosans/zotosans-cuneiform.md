#### Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform

Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform is a historical Middle Eastern logo-syllabary, written left-to-right. Was used at least since 3200 BCE in today’s Iraq for the now-exinct Sumerian language. Was later used in today’s Iran, Turkey, Syria, and Egypt, for languages like Akkadian, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian and Urartian. Widely believed to be the first writing system in the world. Combined logographic, consonantal alphabetic and syllabic signs. Since c. 900 BCE gradually replaced by the Aramaic script.
